### 15th Thailand Astronomy Olympiad

- **Award:** Bronze Medal
- **Role:** Team Representative, Mahidol Wittayanusorn School

I was selected as one of the six representatives from my school's team camp to participate in the national competition. This was my first-ever academic olympiad, and it was an intensive experience that included both theoretical exams and practical observation tests. Achieving a bronze medal was a significant milestone for me and sparked my passion for tackling complex scientific challenges.
